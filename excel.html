			<h4>Description</h4>
			<h5>• Language and Notable Libraries:</h5>
			<br><desc><strong>>_</strong>Python 3.5</desc>
			<br><desc><strong>>_</strong>openpyxl</desc><br>
			<desc><strong>>_</strong>PyPDF2</desc>
			
			<br><br><h5>• Motivation and Objectives:</h5><br>
			
			<desc>A shop drawing is a document submitted to the engineer by a contractor for approval on a construction project.
			It usually depicts a piece of the construction project like materials, methods,and schedules. 
			The purpose of this program was to automate a significant portion of our department'
			s shop drawing review process. Normally, an engineer would need to print, scan, and
			physically stamp each shop drawing with the entire process taking nearly 30 minutes. </desc><br><br>
			
			<desc>The program is able to read the Shop Drawing Log via openpyxl, 
			generate an electronic stamp from an excel template based on the review status, 
			convert the stamp to a PDF and attach it to the shop drawing PDF found in the file structure.</desc><br><br>
			
			<desc>A transmittal letter is also generated, which summarizes the shop drawings being returned to
			the contractor. The transmittal letter can then be emailed along with the reviewed shop drawings. By using this program,
			company standards and review methods are reinforced, reducing errors and inconsistencies.</desc>
			
			<br><br><h5>• Challenges:</h5><br>
			
			<desc>The largest challenge in this project was simplyfying the program so that any non-tech savvy person can easily use it. 
			I needed to strike a balance between keeping the program as simple as possible while fulfilling the objectives I set out to achieve.
			The user does not need to edit this program in any way. The file just needs to be dropped into the correct folder structure
			and use the provided excel templates.</desc>
