			<desc>As an engineer, I love working with my hands. I had an itch to create a useful project that integrated hardware and software. My engineering Capstone project involved using an RPi to create an automated Sequencing Bioreactor for wastewater treatment which t was a great foray into controls and hardware. I wanted to start another fun weekend project that is hands on. </desc><br><br>
			
			<desc>My immediate objectives of the project was to design a sensor suite to measure outdoor temperature, indoor temperature and humidity. The first part of the process was wiring the sensors to the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins. A simple circuit in a pull up congfiration was utilized for each sensor.

			The software controlling and logging the data was written in Python 3.5. The waterproof sensor has an easy output and can be accessed directly without any munging or API's. The DHT11 sensor is more complex in how it transmits data to the computer. Thankfully, Adafruit has an API on GitHub that made extracting indoor temperature and humidity data easy.</desc><br><br>
