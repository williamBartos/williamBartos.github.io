			<h4>Description</h4>
			<h5>• Language and Notable Libraries:</h5>
			<br><desc><strong>>_</strong>Python 3.5</desc>
			<br><desc><strong>>_</strong>matplotlib</desc><br>
			<desc><strong>>_</strong>NumPy</desc>
			
			<br><br><h5>• Motivation and Objectives:</h5><br>
			
			<desc>Coming from an Environmental Engineering background, I have a strong knowledge and passion for fluid dynanmics. 
			Combining my love of fluids with my love of code led me to this interesting field and provided me with a great opportunity
			to expand my knowledge while having fun.</desc><br><br>
			
			<desc>The programs I wrote are based on Lorena Barbra's "12 Steps to Navier-Stokes",which are a series of Python based programs
			to model various fluid dynamics phenomena and theories.</desc><br><br>
			
			<desc>The exercises start off simple with 1D simulations describing linear/nonlinear convection and ddiffusion. The complexity gradually increases to 2D
			. Equations fundamental to fluid dynamics, such as Burger's Equation, the Laplace Equation, and Poisson's Equation are all covered.</desc>
			
			<desc>By utilizing NumPy, derived 1st and 2nd order partial differential equations can be represented in Python using the finite-difference method. Plots of the program output
			are then created using matplotlib.</desc>
			
			
			<br><br><h5>• Challenges:</h5><br>
			
			<desc>The challenge of writing these programs are that they take an advanced knowledge of fluid dynamics and differential equations. Thankfully, Lorena Barbara has provided
			detailed derivations which were easy to follow. Translating these sophisticated equations into understandable code was also difficult as well. These programs really helped push my 
			knowledge of </desc>
