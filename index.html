            <p>
				I should be doing work right now.
				<br><br>
				That phrase alone pretty much sums up my experiences since beginning my masters program roughly two months ago. Since leaving my professional civil engineering job of ~2 years and returning to school, learning to be a student again has been challenging. Working full time meant clocking in at 8 am and leaving (hopefully) not too late after 5. Occasionally I'd take a challenging problem mentally home with me to ruminate over, but I wouldn't have to act on it until the next day. 
				<br><br>
				So how is this different than being an undergrad again? It isn't really, except that my perspectives have changed. For most undergrads, school has been their full time job their entire lives. Working professionally has changed my work ethic for the better-I'm vastly more driven and efficient than I was back when sleeping at 3am and waking at 1pm was the norm. Many engineers go through this same transformation. 
				<br><br>
				The issue is that when working full time, this heightened productivity can be contained neatly within work hours. In grad school, I have to be able to work at this level at any time. There's no off switch. The whip cracking phrase of "I should be doing work right now" permeates nearly every activity. 
				<br><br>
				What's humorous too is that as a civil engineer, I worked on multimillion dollar projects that impacted the lives of thousands of people, yet I lose more sleep over an insignificant assignment or exam. 
				<br><br>
				That's not to say I'm not enjoying grad school. So far, its been an amazingly mind expanding experience. I'm getting the time and training towards programming that I've dreamed of for over a year now. And I'm not squandering it.
				<br><br>
				The "I should be working right now" mentality is exhausting. But I'm as long as I can hang on, it'll take me where I want to be.
